# Physical Actions Classification for Exoskeleton Assistance

## Introduction
This project focuses on using machine learning to classify physical actions for exoskeleton assistance, with a primary goal of providing limb mobility assistance. By automating the recognition and classification of physical actions based on electromyography (EMG) signals, the project aims to empower individuals recovering from strokes to perform therapeutic movement patterns. The significance lies in improving rehabilitation processes and freeing up human caregivers for customized treatment regimens.
